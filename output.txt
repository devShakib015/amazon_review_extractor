Review Title:
 it's a Mac, not a PC, so you can't expect much but it works.

Review Content:
I begrudgingly had to buy a Mac to run a specific software for my work that wasn't available for PCs and normal people. I worked in IT for years and have always hated Macs and how they've been marketed mainly to the computer illiterate like a cult and are entirely dumbed down, and this isn't the first one I've owned. The 8-9 PCs around the house can't run the silly book editing software. So I figured what the heck - I'll buy an Amazon "renewed" Mac.

For what you get, as always, Macs are WAY overpriced (about 3x). This one is no exception. $641 for a "meh" computer with "meh" performance - even used. It runs well (i.e. doesn't crash) and got the job done. But now it sits in the corner and is hardly ever used.

My son tried to run games on it to get some use out of it but even his i5 Surface well outperforms this thing.

If you drank the Koolaid and are part of the Mac cult, this thing's probably for you. Personally I just have to ignore the Apple with the bite taken out symbolizing the "Fall of Man". At least I didn't pay $666.66 for it like all the Macs when they were first released back in the day.

Review Title:
 Mac Mini is lightening fast! But Amazon needs to change wording policy for renewed products.

Review Content:
The Mac mini with Apple’s new M1 chip is lighting fast! It amazes me how far computer technology has advanced since I first purchased the Apple II with only 48k of ram and the size of a large electric typewriter back in the early 80’s. When I first saw how fast the Mac mini performed I thought it may look mini but it has major power on the inside.

Now for my complaint with Amazon. In the description for the Mac mini it said New Mac Mini... it is only at the end of the description does it say renewed. I think a more accurate description would be “Renewed Mac mini...” When I initially saw this i thought “Wow, a new Mac mini for only $626! That’s $38 cheaper than Amazon’s regular price of $664. And it says there is only 1 left. I better hurry and purchase it before someone else does.” Okay, I have learned my lesson to read the full product description of the item before making a purchase decision.

When my Mac mini arrived I opened the box only to find another sealed box on the inside. This box had a sticker that said in bold letters “New Item” instead of “Renewed Item” Also there was another sticker that said “Amazon Warehouse Deals Inspected and Repackaged” When I saw these stickers I was confused because initially I thought I purchased a brand new Mac mini. After opening the second box there was the typical white Apple box shrink wrapped in clear plastic. I removed the shrink wrap and opened the box and there was the Mac mini wrapped in Apple’s white opaque product wrapping. I removed that wrapping and there was a blemish free Mac mini aluminum case along with the information and the Apple decal stuck in a white folder along with the power cord fastened with paper straps. After purchasing many Apple products over the years I thought no way is this a renewed product everything looks so perfect. It even has that brand new Apple smell to it. Next I decided to call Amazon. I explained to the representative that it appears I purchased a brand new Mac mini. The representative said “No, it is renewed.” I then told the representative that I made a mistake in thinking I purchased a brand new Mac mini. The representative was kind enough to say I could return it. In spite of what the representative stated that it was a renewed item, and I was 99% positive it was brand new Mac mini.

Now the good news. I decided to give Apple a call and spoke with a representative in the sales department. I explained the situation to the representative and asked them if I gave them the serial number on the Mac mini could they check to see if it was brand new or previously owned? The representative responded “Yes.” I gave the representative the serial number and in less than a minute the representative replied it is a brand new Mac mini. I had the representative repeat the serial number back to me to make sure they looked up the correct one. The representative also explained that it was eligible for Apple Care which extends the standard 1 year warranty to 3 years.

The representative offered to transfer me to Apple Care if I wanted to purchase the extended warranty. I told the representative to transfer me to Apple Care. The representative at Apple Care asked for the serial number and a screen shot of my invoice from Amazon. The representative told me that everything is fine and I purchased Apple Care using Apple pay for $99.

I don’t know how or what happened. It’s rare for Amazon to make a mistake in the customer’s favor but in my case I guess the God of Luck was looking down upon me and thought “This guy has already spent thousands of dollars as a Prime Member let’s give him a break.”

Now for a brief message to Mr. Bezos. I know this was a cut in your profit margin. But fear not! I will continue to spend thousands of more dollars for your products because I am an Amazon junkie. Oh, by the way, please consider changing your renewed product wording description policy. Thank you.

Review Title:
 Mouse LAG!!!!!! UPDATED.

Review Content:
I did a loooooong research (I'm the kind of person that does long researches before buying a device, believe me... long) to get a cheap MAC the would do the job for a day to day normal user, web browsing, writing, docs, emails, all the basic stuff that a normal person would do, not needing a powerhouse device. So I came across the mac mini M1, refurbished. GREAT price and the new M1 chip were very attractive.

So after buying the computer and trying to connect the bluetooth mouse and keyboard I noticed that there was THE LAG!!! (which I read so much about but read other people reporting that they were not having those issues). The lag was BAD!!!! So I researched and tried everything.... and I DID try everything, to the point of having to buy a corded mouse and after plugging it, there was some improvement but nothing compared to how a normal computer with a normal cursor would move. And I even tried the mouse (a cheap one from macally created for MACs) and it worked perfectly without any flaws. But in this one it keeps having some lag still. So if you're thinking either to buy this, the iMac 24 inch with M1 chip or waiting for a bigger iMac M1 chip and possible 27 inch, I suggest to go for any of the 2 latter but DONT BUY THE M1 MAC MINI. There are reports everywhere of the lag happening, improving to some extent for some people but not completely going away. And let me tell you, IT IS GOING TO DRIVE YOU CRAZY. So don't do the same mistake.

UPDATE:

Turns out that afte changing the monitor to a 1440p, 140 hz, 27 inch monitor (I got ViewSonic) the lag disappeared completely. So it has to do with the monitor moreso that the corded mouse. But it's a good idea to get the mouse corded also.

Review Title:
 Good Value on the base M1 Mac mini

Review Content:
I am the Apple tech for my school district. I recently bought an iPad Pro 12.9" (M1) over getting a MacBook but still wanted a desktop Mac at home when needed. My 2012 Mac mini was unable to update past Catalina. I didn't want to spend much so I ordered this one in hopes it would be OK. The packaging was very good though it could have used a bit more bubble wrap to keep the insides from moving around during transit. However the mini was extremely well packed inside a double layer of padding. The only issue I've observed in this renewed product so far is that when it first booted it sounded like the internal speaker is partially blown. I don't use the internal speaker so it's not an issue and I wouldn't bother to return it just for that. Everything else about it is fine. Getting it up and running was routine. Since this is something I do several times a week in my job I know when something isn't right, even if it's minor. The mini is fine and I'm happy with my purchase. Hope this helps.

Review Title:
 I'm late to the game but the hype is real, the base model Mac Mini is still worth it in 2022

Review Content:
I decided to by the M1 Mac Mini base model refurbished because the deal was simply too good to pass up.
It was replacing my 2018 gaming laptop that started blue screening and eventually failed to boot.

Being a photographer and working from home a dependable computer is must.
I was able to get the refurbished Mac Mini and the 3 year protection plan for $588 out the door. It seemed like the value of the year, and it turns out it was.

The m1 was able to easily handle photo editing and 4k video editing. For a system with such modest specs It absolutely smoked my i58300h and 1050ti with 32GB of ram
I wasn't even able to play back 4k footage smoothly on my gaming PC but the Mac Mini doesn't seem to care. For 8GB of Ram and a 256GB ssd it very easily is able to handle whatever I throw at it.

Since I spent so little on the computer itself I plan on adding a thunderbolt hub and a couple nvme enclosures to really maximize the speed of my workflow.

Review Title:
 I love this M-1, but it does have its idiosyncrasies

Review Content:
Having started on a Mac Plus many, many years ago, I am amazed at how the Mac, especially the mini, has evolved. This machine is lightning fast and all it purports to be. However, there are some idiosyncrasies. One I find interesting is that my monitor is hooked up through the HDMI port. If the mini goes in sleep mode, then when turning it back on, the monitor is a grey screen. I had to google to find out that this, indeed, happens with the M1 and how to easily fix it. 'Still annoying though.

Review Title:
 What's not to like.

Review Content:
I ordered the Mac Mini M1 on Friday with standard free shipping from the vendor and it was delivered the next day (Saturday) by UPS. I'm still in shock. The computer out of the box looked new. I already had the peripherals so I connected everything and was amazed at the performance. I'm not doing any heavy lifting, web browsing, 3D Printing software, DAC for audio and some 4X games. My first computer was a VIC-20 back in 1980 but this unit surpasses any computer I've built or purchased by a large margin. The MacOS is nice but I come from a Linux environment so in the end I'll probably install Parallels and run Linux. The M1 processor that Apple has created is truly a marvel. For video or audio editing on the cheap pickup the 16 GB RAM model with the 512 GB of storage and you will be a happy camper. For the normal computer user the base model with 8 GB is fine. For additional storage and ports there are a number of docks with built in SSD slot made for the Mac Mini M1 available on Amazon.

 Nothing Really Impressive If You Use RAM

Review Content:
Between Affinity Designer, Blender, Unity, Mail, and Safari, this model chugged along at not much better pace than my 2018 i5 Intel model with 32Gb of RAM (minus the fan, which kept me warm in the winter), so I returned it.

Ended up going with the base model with 16GB of RAM, and that one makes a HUGE different, especially with rendering out of Blender.

Buy this model only if you don't use such RAM hogs.

It does put out less heat, though.

 Apple Mac mini M1 - A great computer

Review Content:
My MacBook Air crashed and I needed a low cost alternative. Apple didn't disappoint. This Mac mini with the M1 chip is super fast. It's so fast I never hear it running since it has an SSD instead of HD and no internal fan. But it doesn't get hot. It's the coolest computer I've ever owned which is a good indicator of how long it will last. Great job Apple. Thanks Amazon.

 Great price, excellent device

Review Content:
This arrived very quickly, the seller (Loop-mobile) got it to me a couple of days early, in a plain brown box, and well packaged. Machine looks basically brand new, besides a label attached directly to the top, that came off clean, with minimal effort. Machine has been fired up, updated easily, and run for a full day, connecting well to all my other devices, and working flawlessly. Incredibly impressed by the ease of use, performance, and overall, this is simply a joy to use. Would highly recommend for anyone needing a basic computer to do internet, office, email, and any other work with, with the obvious caveat that it's not for high end power usage. Might still surprise you even so, but this is a great, inexpensive way to get into macOS without worry.

 Just a scratch on the body but I don't care

This was a gift for my husband to replace his 8 year old macbook. Price was so good to be true, but as other review said, it came with some big box with not tight seal or any fancy case. And I found some scratches and dents on the machine but who cares. It's not that important to see how the computer works, fast and fabulous! Since we use heavy programs, like Adobe Indesign and Photoshop, hope no slow-downs or no crashes. It's been about over a month of use, my husband is in love with this machine. That's all I expected!

 Arrived Like New

Review Content:
Love this little computer. I've never owned a Mac but wanted to try one. The renewed price for the Mac Mini M1 seemed too good to pass up, so I took a chance. It arrived in perfect condition in the original Apple box. I thought it would be a toy, or I would use it to learn photo and video editing. Now I'm using it all day alongside my work computer and I've bought it a 4K monitor and Magic Keyboard. It makes my expensive I-7 laptop seem a bit slow in comparison. So good I'm thinking about buying a second one for my wife.

 The new M1 chip is powerful.

Review Content:
The new Mac mini with the M1 Apple Silicon chip is fantastic! It has way exceeded my expectations. I have been using Macs for over 20 years and have purchased several Mini’s over that time. I have always preferred the iMacs due to better performance but this M1 Mini is great. The 8GB version has been fine for my basic computing needs. If I was running video or photo editing or more intensive apps I would have opted fir the 16GB version. This “renewed” one from Amazon looks brand new. I just purchased a new one and then got this renewed one. I can’t tell the difference between them. I consider it an absolute value! Thanks Amazon!

Review Title:
 Nice - but be aware!

Review Content:
Very good Mac Mini - fast and efficient. But one should remember that neither the hard drive nor the memory can be replaced or modified.

 Like new!

Review Content:
I bought this because I wanted a good home computer that didn’t need to be a laptop. The unit is super fast and just like new. Buying a refurbished unit is the way to go by saving some money without sacrificing quality.

Review Title:
 I use this for video and it's phenomenal

Review Content:
I used a beefed up Intel MacBook pro to doy video production in the past but times have been catching up and davinci resolve was getting laggy and annoying. I'm running davinci resolve 18 beta on this little box with only 8 gigs of ram and almost everything happens in realtime. I have yet to hear a fan even during complicated renders. I have no complaints so far but that I wish I'd bought one with more storage.

Review Title:
 Excellent Value If Upgrading From An Older MacMini.

Review Content:
While I'm not a demanding performance user of Apple computer products - with the arrival of the M1 chip, I decided to upgrade my 2014 MacMini with the "renewed" Apple product from Amazon's vendors. I immediately noticed a more "snappy" performance with program loading and better Bluetooth connectivity. While the pricing difference between a new Apple MacMini and Amazon's "renewed" product was only $ 150.00 - for my application I saw no need to spend the extra money for a factory "new" product.

Review Title:
 Great little Mac.

Review Content:
Works great, super fast, easy set-up, extremely low power consumption, working great on 2 large monitors. Got this to replace my aging MacPro that couldn't update OS any longer and couldn't run my tax software. I was worried about only 8GB of memory but so far so good. Only thing I miss is the storage but iCloud storage and an external hard drive make up for that.

Review Title:
 Absolutely awesome value for the money

Review Content:
Got this Mac mini renewed from Amazon and exceptionally pleased with it. Came in a generic white box with a power cord, unit itself looks brand new - and works great. No Apple warranty remaining, but a current model, M1 Mac for under $500 in this economy? I cannot complain.

 My first Apple since a Mac Plus

Review Content:
Works like other Apples. Sometimes, with enough patience and retries, but OS 12 isn’t ready for prime time. Some day it will be a good Linux box, but today, Intel has that market too. My Logitech accessories help where Apple keyboard, mouse, third party hubs and most backup products fail with the new mini.

 I hate iOS, but still think this is well worth the money for content creators

Review Content:
I've never liked Apple, but this M1 Mac Mini is way too good of a deal to pass up.

If we were going to buy a PC with a similar level of hardware, it would cost well over $1,000.

For the objectively low price of $800, I can handle the many little annoyances that comes with having an iOS machine (or which there are many).

 WOULDN’T TURN ON!

Review Content:
BUYER BEWARE!

Received the refurbished Mac mini and the unit wouldn’t even turn on. Tried several outlets, plugged, unplugged, replugged, pushed the button again and again and waited for it to start up. Dead as a door nail.

I’ve purchased refurbished iPhones before, so I thought why not try a Mac mini for my daughter for school. I just went to Apple and purchased from their refurbished site online.

Call it a blessing that it didn’t work from the get go because down the line would have been worse. Returned immediately and waiting for my refund.

 Not working well after using only over a month!

Review Content:
It's flickering in and out after just over a month of use. And crashed on me twice. I'm not running anything intense just work stuff. Verry disappointing 😞 the on board video card must be also having issues because I see the screen go fussy if I try to play am actual game.

Review Title:
 Avant’s description of like new is totally inaccurate.

Review Content:
I will no longer trust buying anything renewed because of my experience with Avant. “Like new” obviously means something different to me than to them. The Mac Mini I ordered from them did not come in the original Apple package as expected and was poorly wrapped with one thin piece of bubble wrap inside of a plain cardboard box. The Mac Mini had a large sticker identifying it slapped on its top. The Mac Mini had scratches and marks on it. My 7 yr old Mac Mini has no scratches or marks! Apple told me that it was too old to give me the usual warranty and also that its age made it unqualified for the extended warranty. At best, this Mac Mini should have been labeled as “acceptable,” definitely not “like new.”

Review Content:
Not only was this not secured in the box when it was shipped but it's dirty and defective. Thus isn't even the correct power cord. This is probably the worse purchase off Amazon.

I understand we have to make a living , but with a few extra bucks I can get a brand new one with apple’s warranty.

 My best computer in the last 6 years.

Review Content:
The best computer in the universe! Very quiet, small and beautiful. It is a pleasure to use the software, which is made specially for Mac OS. Some software works crookedly, but this is the fault of specific developers. Sometimes I even play games on it, but many games run under Windows and old Mac OS.

Review Title:
 Best Mac Mini I’ve owned

Review Content:
Apple products can be all over the map. I have a 2009 Mac that works well. The same for an old IPod. My last Mac Mini was a problem child, so I replaced it with a refurbished one from Loop-Mobile. I have had terrific experiences with Refurbished phones from Amazon, so I have high hopes for this one. I like being able to choose whatever monitor and keyboard and mouse I like. I appreciate the portability. This one came with the latest operating system, which is an assurance it hasn’t been sitting in someone’s warehouse. For the price, compared to Apple, its certainly worth the chance. This model is a huge improvement over my previous one.

Review Title:
 With AppleCare, In a bubble wrap with a power cable only

Review Content:
I’ve got Renewed M1 Mini for 486 bucks. Arrived as expected, fast. Looks very good, has an inventory white sticker on the body itself. No original items or packaging other than the unit itself in a bubble wrap. Included power cord is not original.

In my case it came with AapleCare till December 2023, but the thing about AppleCare - it may disappear any time due to in some cases it can be cancelled by the initial buyer.

It came with seemingly fresh Monterrey, but I’ve reset it again just for the peace of mind.

Overall I think it’s a great deal.

There is no better computer than an M1 Mac mini for doing most anything including video editing 4K footage. I have two of these M1 max in my home and they are just absolutely the best computer to have. Supply a mouse keyboard and monitor actually a 30 inch TV 4K and you are in.
